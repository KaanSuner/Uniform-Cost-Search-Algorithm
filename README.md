# Uniform-Cost-Search-Algorithm
## Describing UCS Algoritm
UCS is an algorithm that provides the ability to search in a tree or graph with node weights at minimal cost. It is implemented using priorityqueue due to its structure. In this way, low costs have a higher priority during the search. It is the most appropriate algorithm to use when low cost is desired.
## UCS implementation
I asked the user to input the path for the data file to create the first graph. I have confirmed whether this file path is valid. If not valid, I asked the user to login again. If valid, data in csv format was read. Since the first line is a header, it has been skipped. Then the data was separated accordingly and created graph using the dictionary structure. Cities and distances are stored separately in the dictionary structure. For the UCS function, the starting and target cities were first asked to the user. An error check has been made against incorrect city entries. City entries received from the user were used as parameters in UCS. I used priorityqueue in the UCS function and put the first city input I got from the user in the first priority. I checked that all cities that need to be visited until reaching the last city are visited and de-queued according to the distance between cities.
